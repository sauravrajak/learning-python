Python is a popular general-purpose programming language. It is used in machine learning, web development, desktop applications, and many other
fields. Fortunately for beginners, Python has a simple, easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python a great language to learn for beginners.


Python Keywords and Identifiers

Python Keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special
meanings to the compiler.
We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They
are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
All the keywords except True ,
False and None are in lowercase and they must be
written as they are. The list of all the keywords is given below.

# Python Identifiers
# Identifiers are the name given to variables, classes, methods, etc.
# For example,
 
language = "Python"

# Here, languagel is a variable (an identifier) which holds the value 'Python' .
# We cannot use keywords as variable names as they are reserved names that are 
# built-in
# to Python. For example,

# continue = 'Python' --> wrong syntax 


"""
Rules for Naming an Identifier
    • Identifiers cannot be a keyword.
    • Identifiers are case-sensitive.
    • It can have a sequence of letters and digits. However, it must begin with 
      a letter or The first letter of an identifier cannot be a digit.
    • Itis a convention to start an identifier with a letter rather
    • Whitespaces are not allowed.
    • We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, S, and so on.



Things to Remember
    Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and I variable are not the
    same.
    Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense. While
        c = 10 is a valid name,
    writing count = 10 would make more sense, and it would be easier to figure 
    out what it
    represents when you look at your code after a long gap.
    Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, like .
